Customizing flow visualization often requires complicated interactionsâ€¦

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,430
To reduce the interaction effort, we design FlowNL.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,330
FlowNL supports queries of flow structures in natural languages.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,000
It translates natural queries into declarative specifications for visualization.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,500
It allows users to define new features using various kinds of existing structures.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
In our study, users can customize visualization easily using FlowNL.
